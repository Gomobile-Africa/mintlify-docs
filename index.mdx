## Why Gomobile?

Building reliable communication automation is harder than it looks. You need to manage flows, handle retries gracefully, respect business hours, and track every interaction across channels. Gomobile solves these challenges out of the box.

Here's what makes it different:

- **Omni-Channel Flows** - Design complex communication logic with a node-based system. Send messages via voice, SMS, or WhatsApp—all from a unified flow builder.

- **Smart Retry Strategies** - Not every message gets through on the first try. Configure fixed-delay retries, scheduled follow-ups, or let the system handle it automatically.

- **Audience Segmentation** - Organize contacts into audiences and target them with specific campaigns. Add custom attributes to personalize every interaction.

- **Pause Windows** - Respect your recipients' time. Define windows when messages shouldn't go out—lunch breaks, holidays, or outside business hours.

- **Real-time Reporting** - Track every attempt, see exactly which flow nodes executed, and understand why messages succeeded or failed.

- **Audio & Media Management** - Upload custom audio files, use dynamic content playback, and manage dictionaries for multi-language support.
