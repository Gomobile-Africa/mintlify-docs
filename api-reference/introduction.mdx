Welcome to the Gomobile API Reference. This documentation covers all available endpoints for building communication campaigns.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.gomobile.ma/api
```

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key. Include your key in the `x-api-key` header of every request:

```
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Info>
  **Need an API key?** [Request your API

</Info>

## Making requests

Here's an example of an authenticated request:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.gomobile.ma/api/users/me \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Response format

All responses are returned in JSON format:

```json
{
  "id": "user-uuid",
  "email": "you@yourcompany.com",
  "firstName": "Your",
  "lastName": "Name",
  "organization": {
    "id": "org-uuid",
    "name": "Your Company"
  }
}
```

## Error handling

Errors are returned with appropriate HTTP status codes:

| Status Code | Description                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 400         | Bad Request - Invalid parameters             |
| 401         | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API key    |
| 403         | Forbidden - Insufficient permissions         |
| 404         | Not Found - Resource doesn't exist           |
| 409         | Conflict - Resource already exists           |
| 429         | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded      |
| 500         | Internal Server Error - Something went wrong |

Error responses include details:

```json
{
  "error": "ValidationError",
  "message": "Invalid phone number format",
  "details": {
    "field": "primaryPhone",
    "value": "invalid"
  }
}
```

## Rate limiting

API requests are rate limited to ensure fair usage:

- **Default**: 100 requests per minute
- **Burst**: Up to 200 requests in short periods

When rate limited, you'll receive a `429` status code. Implement exponential backoff for retries.

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination:

```bash
GET /contacts?page=1&limit=20
```

Response includes pagination metadata:

```json
{
  "data": [],
  "meta": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "totalPages": 5,
    "totalItems": 100,
    "hasNextPage": true,
    "hasPrevPage": false
  }
}
```
