Dictionaries map words, numbers, and phrases to audio files. They enable dynamic content playback—reading phone numbers, dates, currency amounts, and custom vocabulary during calls.

## How dictionaries work

Instead of pre-recording every possible message, you:

1. Record individual words or number sounds
2. Organize them in a dictionary
3. Reference the dictionary in your flows
4. Gomobile assembles the audio dynamically

For example, to say "Your balance is 1,523 dirhams":

- Play "Your balance is" (pre-recorded)
- Play "1523" (assembled from dictionary: "one", "thousand", "five", "hundred", "twenty", "three")
- Play "dirhams" (from dictionary)

## System dictionaries

Gomobile provides built-in dictionaries for common use cases:

| Language      | Contents              |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| Arabic (`ar`) | Numbers, common words |
| French (`fr`) | Numbers, common words |

System dictionaries include:

- Digits (0-9)
- Tens (10, 20, 30...)
- Hundreds (100, 200...)
- Thousands and millions
- Common connectors ("and", "point")

## Creating a custom dictionary

For custom vocabulary, create your own dictionary:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.gomobile.ma/api/dictionaries \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Payment Terms",
    "description": "Payment-related vocabulary",
    "language": "ar"
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "dictionary-uuid",
  "name": "Payment Terms",
  "description": "Payment-related vocabulary",
  "language": "ar",
  "organizationId": "org-uuid",
  "isSystem": false,
  "createdAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Adding entries

Add audio entries to your dictionary:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.gomobile.ma/api/dictionaries/DICTIONARY_ID/entries \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/dirham.wav" \
  -F "key=dirham"
```

Common keys for a payment dictionary:

- `dirham` / `dirhams`
- `payment` / `payments`
- `due` / `overdue`
- `balance`
- `total`

## Using dictionaries in flows

Reference dictionaries in Play nodes:

### Number playback

```json
{
  "type": "number",
  "value": { "source": "customAttribute", "attributeName": "accountBalance" },
  "mode": "full",
  "language": "ar",
  "dictionaryId": null
}
```

Setting `dictionaryId` to `null` uses the system dictionary. Specify a custom dictionary ID for custom pronunciations.

Number modes:

| Mode       | Example (1234)                         | Output         |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `full`     | "one thousand two hundred thirty four" | Natural speech |
| `twoByTwo` | "twelve, thirty-four"                  | Digit pairs    |

### Date playback

```json
{
  "type": "date",
  "value": { "source": "customAttribute", "attributeName": "dueDate" },
  "mode": "dayMonthYear",
  "language": "ar",
  "dictionaryId": null
}
```

Date modes:

| Mode           | Example (15/01/2025)                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `dayMonthYear` | "fifteen January two thousand twenty-five"    |
| `monthAsWord`  | "January fifteenth, two thousand twenty-five" |

### Word playback

```json
{
  "type": "word",
  "value": "dirham",
  "language": "ar",
  "dictionaryId": "custom-dictionary-id"
}
```

Or with dynamic values:

```json
{
  "type": "word",
  "value": { "source": "customAttribute", "attributeName": "currencyWord" },
  "language": "ar",
  "dictionaryId": "custom-dictionary-id"
}
```

## Listing dictionaries

View all dictionaries:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.gomobile.ma/api/dictionaries \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Returns both system and custom dictionaries.

## Getting dictionary entries

Look up a specific entry:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.gomobile.ma/api/dictionaries/DICTIONARY_ID/entries/dirham \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "entry-uuid",
  "dictionaryId": "dictionary-uuid",
  "key": "dirham",
  "audioId": "audio-uuid",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Removing entries

Delete an entry:

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.gomobile.ma/api/dictionaries/DICTIONARY_ID/entries/dirham \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Deleting dictionaries

Remove a custom dictionary:

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.gomobile.ma/api/dictionaries/DICTIONARY_ID \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Note>
You can't delete system dictionaries.

## Recording tips for dictionaries

1. **Consistent voice** - Use the same voice talent for all entries
2. **Neutral intonation** - Avoid rising or falling tones that imply sentence endings
3. **Clean starts and ends** - Trim silence from recordings
4. **Test combinations** - Listen to how entries sound together
5. **Consider context** - Numbers may need different pronunciations in different contexts

## Language support

Currently supported:

| Code | Language |
| ---- | -------- |
| `ar` | Arabic   |
| `fr` | French   |

Additional languages can be added via custom dictionaries with appropriate audio.

## Best practices

- **Start with system dictionaries** - They cover most number needs
- **Custom dictionaries for domain terms** - Industry-specific vocabulary
- **Organize by purpose** - Separate dictionaries for different use cases
- **Document your keys** - Keep a reference of what each key means
- **Test thoroughly** - Listen to dynamic playback with real data
