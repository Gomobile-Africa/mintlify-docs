Execution reports provide comprehensive analytics for your calling campaigns, including contact metrics, call metrics, and node-level statistics.

## Main execution report

Get the primary report for an execution:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.gomobile.ma/api/program-execution/EXECUTION_ID/report \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Response:

```json

## Effective status

The `effectiveStatus` includes computed pause window state:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `scheduled` | Waiting for start time |
| `running` | Actively processing |
| `paused_manual` | User explicitly paused |
| `paused_window` | In a pause window |
| `completed` | All contacts processed |
| `stopped` | Reached stop time |
| `cancelled` | Manually cancelled |

## Contact metrics

Metrics aggregated from unique contacts:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `totalContacts` | Audience size at launch |
| `pending` | Waiting to be called |
| `queued` | In call queue |
| `calling` | Currently on call |
| `pendingRetry` | Waiting for retry |
| `completed` | Successfully reached |
| `failed` | All retries exhausted |
| `skipped` | Skipped (cancelled, stopped) |
| `reachRate` | `completed / totalContacts × 100` |

## Call metrics

Metrics aggregated from all call attempts:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `totalCalls` | All call attempts |
| `answered` | Calls that connected |
| `completed` | Flow completed successfully |
| `voicemail` | Voicemail detected |
| `noAnswer` | Ring timeout |
| `busy` | Busy signal |
| `rejected` | Call rejected |
| `failed` | System/network error |
| `answerRate` | `answered / totalCalls × 100` |
| `completionRate` | `completed / answered × 100` |

<Note>
Call metrics can exceed contact count due to retries. For example, 1000 contacts with 2 retries can generate up to 3000 calls.

        "1": 2000,
        "2": 1200,
        "3": 600
      },
      "dtmfPercentages": {
        "1": 52.63,
        "2": 31.58,
        "3": 15.79
      }
    }
  ],
  "totalCalls": 6200,
  "completedCalls": 3500,
  "completionRate": 56.45
}
```

### Understanding node stats

- **uniqueCalls**: Number of different calls that executed this node
- **totalExecutions**: Total times the node was executed (includes loops)
- **percentage**: Percentage of total calls that reached this node
- **dtmfBreakdown**: For DTMF nodes, shows digit distribution

<Note>
Node stats are not a traditional funnel because call flows can branch and loop. We report unique calls per node, not drop-off rates.
