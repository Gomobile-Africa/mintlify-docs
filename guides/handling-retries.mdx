---

Improving your connection rate is crucial for campaign success. This guide covers why calls fail, how to configure retries effectively, and how to analyze your results.

## Why calls fail

Understanding failure reasons helps you configure better retries:

| Outcome | Cause | Retry helps? |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| Busy | Recipient on another call | Yes, likely |
| No Answer | Recipient unavailable | Yes, try different time |
| Rejected | Recipient declined call | Maybe, depends on reason |
| Voicemail | Machine answered | Depends on goal |
| Network Error | Technical issue | Yes, usually temporary |

## Measuring your baseline

Before optimizing, measure your current performance:

```bash
curl -X GET /program-executions/EXECUTION_ID \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Calculate your connection rate:

```
Connection Rate = contactsCompleted / totalContacts × 100
```

Typical benchmarks:
- **First attempt**: 20-40% connection rate
- **With 1 retry**: 30-50%
- **With 2-3 retries**: 40-60%

Your results will vary based on audience, timing, and industry.

## Choosing a retry strategy

### No retries

```json
{ "type": "none" }
```

**Use when:**
- Testing flows
- One-shot notifications
- You'll handle retries externally
- Very time-sensitive messages

### Fixed delay

```json
{
  "type": "fixed_delay",
  "delayMinutes": 30,
  "maxRetries": 2
}
```

**Use when:**
- Standard campaigns
- Predictable retry timing needed
- Consistent recipient behavior expected

**Recommended settings:**

| Urgency | Delay | Max Retries | Total Attempts |
|---------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| High | 15 min | 3-4 | 4-5 |
| Medium | 30-60 min | 2-3 | 3-4 |
| Low | 120+ min | 1-2 | 2-3 |

### Scheduled

```json
{
  "type": "scheduled",
  "retryDates": [
    "2025-01-20T10:00:00Z",
    "2025-01-20T15:00:00Z",
    "2025-01-21T10:00:00Z"
  ]
}
```

**Use when:**
- Different times of day might work better
- Compliance requires specific timing
- Multi-day campaigns
- Weekend/weekday differences matter

## Optimizing retry timing

### Finding the best times

Track which retry times produce the best results:

```
Morning (9-11 AM): Often best for business contacts
Midday (12-2 PM): Lower answer rates (lunch)
Afternoon (2-5 PM): Good for most audiences
Evening (5-8 PM): Best for consumer contacts
```

### Day of week patterns

- **Monday**: Often busy, moderate answer rates
- **Tuesday-Thursday**: Generally best days
- **Friday**: Lower afternoon rates
- **Weekend**: Varies widely by audience

### Spacing your retries

```
Attempt 1: Campaign start
Attempt 2: +30-60 minutes
Attempt 3: Different time of day
Attempt 4: Next day
```

This gives you coverage across different availability patterns.

## Combining retries with pause windows

Retries respect pause windows. Configure them together:

```json
{
  "retryStrategy": {
    "type": "fixed_delay",
    "delayMinutes": 60,
    "maxRetries": 3
  },
  "pauseWindows": {
    "monday": [
      { "startAt": { "hour": 12, "minute": 0 }, "endAt": { "hour": 14, "minute": 0 } },
      { "startAt": { "hour": 18, "minute": 0 }, "endAt": { "hour": 23, "minute": 59 } }
    ]
  }
}
```

This ensures retries don't happen during lunch or after hours.

## Analyzing retry results

### Call reports

Get detailed attempt information:

```bash
curl -X GET /call-report/JOB_ID \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Response shows all attempts:

```json
{
  "attempts": [
    { "attempt": 1, "outcome": "busy", "call": { "status": "busy" } },
    { "attempt": 2, "outcome": "no_answer", "call": { "status": "no_answer" } },
    { "attempt": 3, "outcome": "completed", "call": { "status": "completed" } }
  ]
}
```

### Metrics to track

**Per-attempt metrics:**
- Connection rate per attempt number
- Time of day correlation
- Day of week correlation
- Outcome distribution

**Campaign metrics:**
- Overall connection rate
- Average attempts needed
- Retry conversion rate (failed → success)

### Retry conversion analysis

Calculate how effective your retries are:

```
Retry Conversion Rate = (Contacts completed after retry) / (Contacts retried) × 100
```

If your retry conversion rate is low (less than 10%), consider:
- Different retry timing
- Fewer retries (save resources)
- Different audience segmentation

## Handling persistent failures

Some contacts never connect. After exhausting retries:

1. **Export failed contacts**
2. **Analyze patterns**
   - Same phone number format?
   - Specific regions?
   - Certain times?
3. **Take action**
   - Remove invalid numbers
   - Try alternative channels (SMS, email)
   - Flag for manual follow-up

### Identifying patterns

```
Failed contacts by outcome:
- 60% no_answer → Try evening hours
- 30% busy → More retries might help
- 10% rejected → Likely wrong numbers
```

## A/B testing retry strategies

Test different strategies to find what works:

### Test setup

1. Split your audience into test groups
2. Create separate programs with different strategies
3. Run simultaneously
4. Compare results

### Example comparison

**Group A:**
```json
{ "type": "fixed_delay", "delayMinutes": 30, "maxRetries": 2 }
```

**Group B:**
```json
{ "type": "fixed_delay", "delayMinutes": 60, "maxRetries": 3 }
```

**Group C:**
```json
{
  "type": "scheduled",
  "retryDates": ["2025-01-20T15:00:00Z", "2025-01-21T10:00:00Z"]
}
```

### Measuring results

After campaigns complete, compare:

| Group | Connection Rate | Avg Attempts | Resource Usage |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|
| A | 45% | 1.8 | 180 calls |
| B | 52% | 2.4 | 240 calls |
| C | 48% | 2.1 | 210 calls |

Choose based on your priorities (connection rate vs. efficiency).

## Advanced techniques

### Progressive retry spacing

Increase delay between attempts:

```json
{
  "type": "scheduled",
  "retryDates": [
    "2025-01-20T10:30:00Z",
    "2025-01-20T12:00:00Z",
    "2025-01-20T15:00:00Z"
  ]
}
```

This schedules retries at +30 min, +90 min, and +180 min intervals.

Useful when you don't want to seem aggressive.

### Time-zone aware scheduling

For contacts across time zones:

1. Segment audience by region
2. Create separate programs
3. Schedule based on local time

### Outcome-based routing

Use flow conditions to handle voicemail differently:

```json
{
  "type": "dial",
  "config": { "enableAMD": true },
  "outputs": {
    "onAnswer": "human-flow",
    "onVoicemail": "leave-message"
  }
}
```

This routes voicemail to leave a message instead of triggering a retry.

## Best practices summary

1. **Start with moderate retries** - 2-3 retries, 30-60 minute delay
2. **Use pause windows** - Respect recipient time
3. **Track your metrics** - Measure before and after changes
4. **Test different approaches** - A/B test strategies
5. **Analyze failures** - Understand why contacts don't connect
6. **Iterate** - Continuously improve based on data

## Common mistakes

- **Too many retries** - Annoying recipients, wasting resources
- **Retrying too quickly** - Situation hasn't changed
- **Ignoring time zones** - Calling at inappropriate hours
- **Not measuring** - Can't improve what you don't track
- **One strategy for all** - Different audiences need different approaches
