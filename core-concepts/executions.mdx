Executions are running instances of programs. When you launch a program, you create an execution that processes the audience, places calls, and tracks progress.

## Understanding executions

Think of the relationship this way:

- **Program** = Recipe (the instructions)
- **Execution** = Cooking session (actually doing it)

You can run the same program multiple times, creating multiple executions. Each execution is independent—it has its own progress, status, and timing.

## Execution lifecycle

Executions move through these states:

```
scheduled ──▶ running ──▶ completed
                │
                ├──▶ paused ──▶ running (resumed)
                │
                └──▶ cancelled

running ──▶ stopped (when stopAt is reached)
```

| Status      | Description                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `scheduled` | Waiting for `startAt` time                   |
| `running`   | Actively processing contacts                 |
| `paused`    | Manually paused, can resume                  |
| `completed` | All contacts processed                       |
| `stopped`   | Reached `stopAt`, remaining contacts skipped |
| `cancelled` | Manually cancelled                           |

## Launching an execution

Create an execution by launching a program:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.gomobile.ma/api/programs/PROGRAM_ID/launch \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "executionId": "770e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440003"
}
```

## Monitoring progress

Check execution status and progress:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.gomobile.ma/api/program-executions/EXECUTION_ID \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "770e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440003",
  "programId": "program-uuid",
  "status": "running",
  "totalContacts": 1500,
  "contactsCompleted": 750,
  "contactsFailed": 45,
  "contactsPending": 680,
  "contactsInProgress": 25,
  "scheduledStartAt": "2025-01-20T09:00:00.000Z",
  "scheduledStopAt": "2025-01-20T18:00:00.000Z",
  "actualStartAt": "2025-01-20T09:00:05.000Z",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-20T08:55:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-01-20T12:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Progress counters

Understanding what each counter means:

| Counter              | Description                                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `totalContacts`      | Audience size at launch (snapshot)              |
| `contactsCompleted`  | Successfully reached (answered, completed flow) |
| `contactsFailed`     | Exhausted all retries                           |
| `contactsPending`    | Waiting to be called (includes retry queue)     |
| `contactsInProgress` | Currently being called or queued                |

These counters always sum to `totalContacts`:

```
totalContacts = contactsCompleted + contactsFailed + contactsPending + contactsInProgress
```

## Pausing and resuming

Pause a running execution:

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.gomobile.ma/api/program-executions/EXECUTION_ID/pause \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

When paused:

- No new calls are initiated
- Calls already in progress continue to completion
- Retry schedules are preserved

Resume a paused execution:

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.gomobile.ma/api/program-executions/EXECUTION_ID/resume \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Cancelling executions

Stop an execution permanently:

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.gomobile.ma/api/program-executions/EXECUTION_ID \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

When cancelled:

- No new calls are initiated
- Calls in progress continue to completion
- Remaining pending contacts are marked as skipped
- Cannot be resumed

## Listing executions

View all executions for a program:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.gomobile.ma/api/programs/PROGRAM_ID/executions \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

View all active executions across your organization:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.gomobile.ma/api/program-executions \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

This returns only active executions (running, scheduled, paused).

## Execution timing

Key timestamps:

| Timestamp          | Description                               |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `scheduledStartAt` | When the execution should begin           |
| `scheduledStopAt`  | When the execution should stop (optional) |
| `actualStartAt`    | When calls actually started               |
| `actualEndAt`      | When the last call completed              |

If an execution reaches `scheduledStopAt` before completing all contacts, it enters `stopped` status and remaining contacts are not called.

## Audience snapshots

When you launch an execution, Gomobile takes a snapshot of the audience. This means:

- Contacts added to the audience after launch are NOT included
- Contacts removed from the audience after launch ARE still called
- This ensures predictable behavior during execution

To include new contacts, launch a new execution.

## Multiple concurrent executions

You can't run multiple executions of the same program simultaneously. If you try to launch while one is already running:

```json
{
  "error": "ExecutionAlreadyRunningError",
  "message": "Program already has a running execution"
}
```

Wait for the current execution to complete, or cancel it first.

## Best practices

- **Monitor progress** - Check counters periodically during large campaigns
- **Set stop times** - Prevent executions from running indefinitely
- **Use pause wisely** - Good for unexpected issues, not routine stops
- **Review failures** - Understand why contacts failed before retrying
- **Clean up** - Don't leave paused executions hanging
