Audiences are groups of contacts. Instead of selecting contacts individually for each campaign, you organize them into audiences and target entire groups.

## Why audiences matter

Audiences solve several problems:

- **Reusability** - Create an audience once, use it across multiple campaigns
- **Segmentation** - Target different groups with different messages
- **Maintenance** - Update audience membership without changing programs
- **Overlap** - The same contact can belong to multiple audiences

Think of audiences as dynamic lists that you can modify independently of your campaigns.

## Creating audiences

Create an audience with a name and optional description:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.gomobile.ma/api/audience \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Premium Customers",
    "description": "Customers on premium subscription plans"
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "organizationId": "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
  "name": "Premium Customers",
  "description": "Customers on premium subscription plans",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Adding contacts to audiences

Once you have an audience, add contacts to it:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.gomobile.ma/api/audience/AUDIENCE_ID/add-contacts \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "contacts": [
      "contact-id-1",
      "contact-id-2",
      "contact-id-3"
    ]
  }'
```

You can add contacts in bulk—useful when importing from external systems.

## Viewing audience contacts

Get a paginated list of contacts in an audience:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.gomobile.ma/api/audience/AUDIENCE_ID/contacts?page=1&limit=20" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "contact-uuid",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "primaryPhone": "+212612345678",
      "primaryEmail": "john@example.com",
      "createdAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "total": 150,
    "totalPages": 8,
    "hasNextPage": true,
    "hasPreviousPage": false
  }
}
```

Search and filter options:

- **Searchable fields**: `firstName`, `lastName`, `primaryPhone`
- **Sortable fields**: `firstName`, `lastName`, `primaryPhone`, `createdAt`

Example with search:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.gomobile.ma/api/audience/AUDIENCE_ID/contacts?search=john&sortBy=firstName&sortOrder=asc" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Listing audiences

View all audiences in your organization:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.gomobile.ma/api/audience?page=1&limit=20" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Search and sort options:

- **Searchable fields**: `name`, `description`
- **Sortable fields**: `name`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

Example with filters:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.gomobile.ma/api/audience?search=premium&sortBy=name&sortOrder=asc" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Updating audiences

Modify audience details:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://api.gomobile.ma/api/audience/AUDIENCE_ID \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "VIP Customers",
    "description": "Updated description for VIP tier"
  }'
```

## Audience strategies

### By customer value

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  All Contacts   │
├─────────────────┤
│ ┌─────────────┐ │
│ │   Premium   │ │  → High-touch campaigns
│ └─────────────┘ │
│ ┌─────────────┐ │
│ │   Standard  │ │  → Regular campaigns
│ └─────────────┘ │
│ ┌─────────────┐ │
│ │    Trial    │ │  → Conversion campaigns
│ └─────────────┘ │
└─────────────────┘
```

### By geography

```
Morocco Customers
├── Casablanca Region
├── Rabat Region
├── Marrakech Region
└── Other Regions
```

### By engagement

```
All Customers
├── Active (contacted in last 30 days)
├── At Risk (no contact in 60 days)
└── Churned (no contact in 90+ days)
```

## Overlapping audiences

Contacts can belong to multiple audiences. This is intentional and useful:

- A contact might be in both "Premium Customers" and "Casablanca Region"
- You can target them with region-specific campaigns AND premium-specific campaigns
- When the same contact appears in multiple executions, Gomobile handles deduplication

## Audience size and campaigns

When you launch a program, Gomobile snapshots the audience at that moment. This means:

- Contacts added after launch won't be included in that execution
- Contacts removed after launch will still be called (they were in the snapshot)
- This ensures predictable behavior for running campaigns

To include new contacts, launch a new execution of the program.

## Deleting audiences

Remove an audience when it's no longer needed:

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.gomobile.ma/api/audience/AUDIENCE_ID \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Deleting an audience doesn't delete the contacts—they remain in the system and can be added to other audiences.

## Best practices

- **Keep audiences focused** - One clear purpose per audience
- **Use descriptive names** - Future you will thank present you
- **Document in descriptions** - Explain the criteria for membership
- **Review periodically** - Remove stale audiences, update membership
- **Consider audience size** - Very large audiences may need multiple executions
