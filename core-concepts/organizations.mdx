An organization is the top-level entity in Gomobile. It represents your company or team and acts as a container for all your resources—users, contacts, flows, programs, and more.

## What organizations do

Organizations provide:

- **Isolation** - Your data is completely separate from other organizations
- **Shared access** - Multiple users can collaborate on the same campaigns
- **Billing boundary** - Usage and subscription plans are tracked per organization
- **Configuration** - Default settings like timezone and currency

## Getting started with an organization

Organizations are created by the Gomobile team when you sign up.

<Info>
  **Need access?** [Request your API
  key](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1F6_7OIDNq8_lWgKPyP-DudF3dvBTl31X4dqVf5St2zE)
  and our team will create your organization and provide credentials.
</Info>

Once your organization is set up, you'll receive credentials to access all organizational resources.

## Viewing your organization

View your organization details through your user profile:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.gomobile.ma/api/users/me \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

The response includes your organization information:

```json
{
  "id": "user-uuid",
  "email": "admin@yourcompany.com",
  "firstName": "Admin",
  "lastName": "User",
  "organization": {
    "id": "org-uuid",
    "name": "Your Company",
    "slug": "your-company",
    "plan": "trial",
    "status": "active",
    "timezone": "Africa/Casablanca"
  }
}
```

Organization updates (name, settings, etc.) require staff permissions. Contact your administrator for changes.

Contact sales for enterprise pricing and custom limits.

## Multi-user access

Multiple users can belong to the same organization. Each user has their own login credentials but shares access to organizational resources.

To add users to your organization, contact your administrator.

## Best practices

- **Keep organization info updated** - Especially contact information for account issues
- **Set the correct timezone** - Scheduling depends on it
- **Regularly audit user access** - Remove users who no longer need access
