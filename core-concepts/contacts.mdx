Contacts are the people you call. They're the foundation of every campaign—you can't make calls without them.

## What contacts store

At minimum, a contact needs a phone number. Beyond that, you can store as much or as little information as you need:

| Field              | Required | Description                            |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `primaryPhone`     | Yes      | The phone number to call               |
| `firstName`        | No       | First name                             |
| `lastName`         | No       | Last name                              |
| `fullName`         | No       | Full name (if you prefer not to split) |
| `primaryEmail`     | No       | Email address                          |
| `address`          | No       | Street address                         |
| `city`             | No       | City                                   |
| `state`            | No       | State or region                        |
| `zip`              | No       | Postal code                            |
| `occupation`       | No       | Job title or occupation                |
| `preferredChannel` | No       | How they prefer to be contacted        |
| `gender`           | No       | `male` or `female`                     |
| `customAttributes` | No       | Any additional data you need           |

## Creating contacts

Add a single contact:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.gomobile.ma/api/contact \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "Fatima",
    "lastName": "Benali",
    "primaryPhone": "+212612345678",
    "city": "Casablanca",
    "customAttributes": {
      "accountBalance": 1500,
      "preferredLanguage": "ar"
    }
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "firstName": "Fatima",
  "lastName": "Benali",
  "primaryPhone": "+212612345678",
  "city": "Casablanca",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Bulk importing contacts

For larger datasets, use the upsert endpoint. It creates new contacts and updates existing ones (matched by phone number):

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.gomobile.ma/api/contact/upsert \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "data": [
      {
        "firstName": "Fatima",
        "lastName": "Benali",
        "primaryPhone": "+212612345678"
      },
      {
        "firstName": "Ahmed",
        "lastName": "Tazi",
        "primaryPhone": "+212612345679"
      },
      {
        "firstName": "Sara",
        "lastName": "Alami",
        "primaryPhone": "+212612345680"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

This is the recommended way to sync contacts from external systems.

## Searching and filtering

List contacts with pagination and search:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.gomobile.ma/api/contact?page=1&limit=20&search=fatima&sortBy=createdAt&sortOrder=desc" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Searchable fields: `firstName`, `lastName`, `fullName`, `primaryPhone`, `primaryEmail`

Sortable fields: `firstName`, `lastName`, `primaryPhone`, `primaryEmail`, `createdAt`

## Updating contacts

Update specific fields without affecting others:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://api.gomobile.ma/api/contact/CONTACT_ID \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "city": "Rabat",
    "customAttributes": {
      "accountBalance": 2000
    }
  }'
```

## Custom attributes

Standard fields don't cover every use case. Custom attributes let you store any additional data:

```json
{
  "customAttributes": {
    "accountBalance": 1500,
    "subscriptionTier": "premium",
    "lastPaymentDate": "2025-01-01",
    "preferredLanguage": "ar",
    "region": "north"
  }
}
```

You can reference custom attributes in your call flows to personalize messages. For example, play back the `accountBalance` value during a payment reminder call.

Before using custom attributes, define them at the organization level. See [Custom Attributes](/features/custom-attributes) for details.

## Phone number format

Gomobile accepts phone numbers in various formats, but we recommend E.164 format for consistency:

```
+212612345678  ✓ Recommended (E.164)
0612345678     ✓ Works (local format)
212612345678   ✓ Works
```

Numbers are stored as provided. Make sure your DID pool numbers and contact numbers use consistent formats for proper caller ID display.

## Deleting contacts

Contacts are soft-deleted, meaning they're hidden but not permanently removed:

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.gomobile.ma/api/contact/CONTACT_ID \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Soft deletion preserves historical data for reporting. Contact support if you need to permanently remove data for compliance reasons.

## Best practices

- **Use consistent phone formats** - Stick to E.164 when possible
- **Keep data clean** - Regularly deduplicate and update stale records
- **Use custom attributes wisely** - Define them before importing data
- **Segment with audiences** - Don't try to filter contacts at call time
