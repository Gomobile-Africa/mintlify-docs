## Authentication & Access

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How do I get an API key?">
API keys are provisioned by the Gomobile team to ensure security and proper access control.

**To request an API key:**

1. Visit our [API Key Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1F6_7OIDNq8_lWgKPyP-DudF3dvBTl31X4dqVf5St2zE)
2. Fill in your details and use case
3. Our team will review and provision your key within 24 hours
4. You'll receive your API key via secure email

Once you receive your key, store it securely and use it in the `Authorization` header:

```
x-api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What authentication method does Gomobile use?">
Gomobile uses API key-based authentication. Your API key is a long-lived credential that you include in every request:

```
x-api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

| Feature            | API Key                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **Lifespan**       | Long-lived                 |
| **Obtained via**   | Request from Gomobile team |
| **Refresh needed** | No                         |
| **Best for**       | All API integrations       |

API keys are provisioned by our team. [Request your API key](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1F6_7OIDNq8_lWgKPyP-DudF3dvBTl31X4dqVf5St2zE) to get started.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My API key stopped working. What happened?">
Common reasons:

1. **Expired** - Your key may have an expiration date
2. **Revoked** - The key may have been revoked for security reasons
3. **Wrong format** - Ensure you're using `x-api-key: <your-key>`
4. **Typo** - Double-check you're using the correct key

**To resolve:** [Contact our support team](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1F6_7OIDNq8_lWgKPyP-DudF3dvBTl31X4dqVf5St2zE) and we'll help you verify your key status or provision a new one.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I have multiple API keys?">
Yes! You can have multiple API keys for different purposes:

- **Per environment**: Separate keys for development, staging, and production
- **Per integration**: One key per third-party service
- **Per team member**: Individual keys for accountability

To request additional API keys, [contact our team](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1F6_7OIDNq8_lWgKPyP-DudF3dvBTl31X4dqVf5St2zE) with your use case.

## Contacts & Audiences

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="What's the difference between a contact and an audience?">
| Concept      | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Contact**  | An individual person with a phone number and optional details (name, email, address, custom attributes) |
| **Audience** | A named group of contacts that can be targeted by a program                                             |

Think of contacts as rows in a database, and audiences as saved filters or segments. One contact can belong to multiple audiences.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can a contact be in multiple audiences?">
Yes! Contacts can belong to any number of audiences simultaneously. Add contacts to an audience using:

```json
POST /audience/:id/add-contacts
{
  "contacts": ["contact-uuid-1", "contact-uuid-2"]
}
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What phone number formats are accepted?">
Phone numbers must be **3-20 characters**. We recommend E.164 format:

```
+[country code][number]
```

Examples:

- ✅ `+212612345678` (Morocco)
- ✅ `+14155551234` (USA)
- ❌ `06-12-34-56-78` (spaces/dashes)
- ❌ `0612345678` (missing country code)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I import contacts in bulk?">
Use the upsert endpoint to import multiple contacts at once:

```json
POST /contact/upsert
{
  "data": [
    {
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "primaryPhone": "+212612345678"
    },
    {
      "firstName": "Jane",
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "primaryPhone": "+212612345679"
    }
  ]
}
```

Existing contacts (matched by phone number) are updated; new contacts are created.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I add custom fields to contacts?">
Yes! First, define a custom attribute for your organization:

```json
POST /custom-attributes
{
  "displayName": "Customer Tier",
  "type": "text"
}
```

Supported types: `text`, `number`, `boolean`, `date`, `phone_number`, `email`, `url`.

Then include it when creating/updating contacts:

```json
{
  "primaryPhone": "+212612345678",
  "customAttributes": {
    "customer_tier": "gold"
  }
}
```

</Accordion>

## Flows & Nodes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="What's the difference between a flow and a program?">
| Concept     | Purpose                                                                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Flow**    | Defines _what happens_ during a call - the logic, audio, inputs, branching       |
| **Program** | Defines _when, who, and how_ - audience, schedule, retry strategy, pause windows |

A flow is like a script; a program is like a scheduled performance of that script to a specific audience.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I reuse flows across multiple programs?">
  Yes! Flows are templates that can be used by many programs. Create the flow
  once, then reference its `flowId` in different programs targeting different
  audiences or schedules.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What node types are available?">
| Node             | Purpose               | Key Outputs                                                                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dial**         | Places outbound call  | `onAnswer`, `onVoicemail`, `onNoAnswer`, `onBusy`, `onRejected`, `onError`   |
| **Answer**       | Answers inbound call  | `onSuccess`, `onError`                                                       |
| **Play**         | Plays audio           | `onComplete`, `onError`                                                      |
| **DTMF**         | Collects keypad input | `branches` (by digit), `onSuccess`, `onTimeout`, `onInvalid`, `onMaxRetries` |
| **Record**       | Records voice         | `onComplete`, `onTimeout`, `onError`                                         |
| **Condition**    | Branches on logic     | `onTrue`, `onFalse`, `onError`                                               |
| **Set Variable** | Stores a value        | `onSuccess`, `onError`                                                       |
| **Hangup**       | Ends the call         | None (terminal)                                                              |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I test a flow before launching?">
Use the validate endpoint to check your flow without saving:

```
POST /flows/validate
```

Pass your flow definition (the `graph` object) in the request body.

Response:

```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "errors": []
}
```

You can also execute a single test call using `POST /flows/execute` with a test contact.

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Calls & Execution

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Why didn't my call go through?">
Check the call report (`GET /call-report/:jobId`) for the `outcome` field:

| Outcome     | Meaning                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `no_answer` | Recipient didn't pick up (timeout reached) |
| `busy`      | Line was busy                              |
| `rejected`  | Recipient declined the call                |
| `failed`    | System error (check `outcomeReason`)       |
| `cancelled` | Call was cancelled before completion       |

Also verify:

- Phone number format is correct
- DID pool has valid numbers
- Program status is `active`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What does 'AMD' mean?">
**AMD = Answering Machine Detection**

When enabled (`enableAMD: true`) on a Dial node, the system detects whether a human or voicemail answered:

- **Human detected** → Routes to `onAnswer`
- **Machine detected** → Routes to `onVoicemail`

This lets you play different messages or skip voicemails entirely.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I stop a running campaign?">
Two options:

1. **Pause** (can resume later):

   ```
   PATCH /program-executions/:id/pause
   ```

2. **Cancel** (permanent):
   ```
   DELETE /program-executions/:id
   ```

Note: Already-queued calls will complete; only pending contacts are affected.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I call the same contact multiple times?">
Yes, through **retry strategies**. If a call fails (no answer, busy, etc.), the system can automatically retry based on your configuration:

- `fixed_delay`: Retry after X minutes
- `scheduled`: Retry at specific times

See [Retry Strategies](/features/retry-strategies) for details.

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

---

## Retry Strategies

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How many times will Gomobile retry a failed call?">
It depends on your retry strategy:

- **`none`**: No retries (1 attempt total)
- **`fixed_delay`**: Up to `maxRetries` additional attempts
- **`scheduled`**: Number of dates in `retryDates` array

Example with 3 retries (4 total attempts):

```json
{
  "type": "fixed_delay",
  "delayMinutes": 30,
  "maxRetries": 3
}
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What triggers a retry?">
Retries are triggered when a call doesn't reach a successful outcome:

- ✅ `completed` - No retry (success)
- 🔄 `no_answer` - Retry
- 🔄 `busy` - Retry
- 🔄 `rejected` - Retry
- 🔄 `voicemail` - Retry (configurable)
- ❌ `failed` - Retry (system error)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do retries respect pause windows?">
  **Yes.** If a retry is scheduled during a pause window, it waits until the
  pause window ends before attempting the call.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Audio & Media

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="What audio formats are supported?">
Upload audio files via `POST /audio-management/upload` using `multipart/form-data`. The system processes and converts files automatically.

Supported content types include:

- `audio/wav`
- `audio/mp3`
- `audio/mpeg`

Audio is processed to telephony-optimized format (8kHz sample rate, mono).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I upload audio files?">
```
POST /audio-management/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

file: [binary audio file]
title: "Welcome Message"
description: "Greeting for customers"
usageType: "welcome"
tags: ["greeting", "intro"]

```

Response includes the `id` to use in your Play nodes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's a dictionary used for?">
Dictionaries map keys to audio files for dynamic content. For example, a "Numbers" dictionary might have:

- Key `"1"` → audio of "one" spoken
- Key `"100"` → audio of "one hundred" spoken
- Key `"thousand"` → audio of "thousand" spoken

Use dictionaries in Play nodes to dynamically construct spoken content like amounts or dates.
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="I'm getting 401 Unauthorized">
**Causes:**

- API key expired or revoked
- Missing or malformed Authorization header
- Typo in your API key

**Solutions:**

1. Check header format: `x-api-key YOUR_API_KEY`
2. Verify you're using the correct API key
3. [Contact our team](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1F6_7OIDNq8_lWgKPyP-DudF3dvBTl31X4dqVf5St2zE) if you need a new API key
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I'm getting 429 Too Many Requests">
You've hit the rate limit. Solutions:

1. **Reduce request frequency** - Add delays between calls
2. **Implement exponential backoff** - Wait longer after each retry
3. **Batch operations** - Use bulk endpoints like `/contact/upsert`
4. **Check response headers** for rate limit details
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My program won't start">
Verify:

1. **`startAt` is in the future** - Or already passed if you want immediate start
2. **Audience is not empty** - `AudienceEmptyError` if no contacts
3. **No existing running execution** - `ExecutionAlreadyRunningError`
4. **Program status is `active`** - Not `draft` or `archived`

Launch with: `POST /programs/:id/launch`
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>
