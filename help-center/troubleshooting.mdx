## Authentication Issues

### 401 Unauthorized

- Request a new API key if issues persist

### 403 Forbidden

## Call Issues

### Calls Not Connecting

- Verify the contact's phone number format (E.164)

### Calls Going to Voicemail

- Enable AMD (`enableAMD: true`) to detect voicemails
- Configure the `onVoicemail` output in your Dial node
- Consider calling at different times

### Audio Not Playing
