Key terms and definitions used throughout Gomobile.

---

## A

### AMD (Answering Machine Detection)

A feature that automatically detects whether a call is answered by a human or a voicemail/answering machine. When enabled on a Dial node, it routes the call to different outputs (`onAnswer` for humans, `onVoicemail` for machines).

---

### API Key

A long-lived authentication credential used for all API communication. API keys are provisioned by the Gomobile team and can have a prefix (e.g., `prod_`, `dev_`) for easy identification. [Request an API key](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1F6_7OIDNq8_lWgKPyP-DudF3dvBTl31X4dqVf5St2zE) to get started.

---

### Audience

A named group of contacts that can be targeted by a program. Contacts can belong to multiple audiences. When a program launches, it creates a snapshot of the audience's contacts at that moment.

---

## C

### Call Request

A request to initiate an outbound call to a specific contact using a defined flow. Includes the contact ID, flow ID, and the phone number to call from.

---

### Campaign

See **Program**. A campaign is the execution of a program against an audience.

---

### Contact

An individual person in your database with at least a phone number. Contacts can have additional fields like name, email, address, and custom attributes. Phone numbers must be in E.164 format (e.g., `+212612345678`).

---

### Custom Attribute

A user-defined field that extends the contact data model. Types include: `text`, `number`, `boolean`, `date`, `phone_number`, `email`, and `url`. Custom attributes can be referenced in flows using the `customAttribute` source type.

---

## D

### Dictionary

A collection of audio files mapped to keys (like "100", "thousand", "and") used to dynamically construct spoken content. Supports Arabic (`ar`) and French (`fr`) languages. System dictionaries are shared; organization dictionaries are private.

---

### DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency)

The tones generated when pressing phone keypad buttons (0-9, *, #). The DTMF node collects these inputs and can branch to different nodes based on which digit was pressed.

---

## E

### Execution

A running instance of a program. Tracks progress with counters: `totalContacts`, `contactsCompleted`, `contactsFailed`, `contactsPending`, `contactsInProgress`. Statuses include: `scheduled`, `running`, `paused`, `completed`, `stopped`, `cancelled`.

---

## F

### Flow

A node-based definition of call logic. Contains a graph of connected nodes (Dial, Play, DTMF, Record, Condition, Set Variable, Hangup) that determine what happens during a call. Flows are reusable across multiple programs.

---

### Flow Node

An individual step within a flow. Each node has a type, configuration, and outputs that connect to other nodes. Terminal nodes (like Hangup) have no outputs.

---

## N

### Node

See **Flow Node**. Available types: `dial`, `answer`, `hangup`, `play`, `record`, `dtmf`, `condition`, `set_variable`.

---

## O

### Organization

A tenant account that contains users, contacts, audiences, flows, programs, and other resources. Has properties like country, timezone, currency, industry, and plan (trial, free, basic, advanced, enterprise).

---

## P

### Pause Window

A time range when calls should NOT be made. Defined per weekday (e.g., lunch break on Monday 12:00-14:00) or as specific date ranges (e.g., Christmas Day). The system skips pulling contacts during paused periods.

---

### Program

A calling campaign configuration that combines an audience, a flow, a DID pool, retry strategy, and scheduling. Programs can be launched to create executions. Status can be: `draft`, `active`, or `archived`.

---

## R

### Retry Strategy

Rules for retrying failed calls. Three types:

- `none`: No retries
- `fixed_delay`: Retry after X minutes, up to Y attempts
- `scheduled`: Retry at specific dates/times

---

## S

### System Variable

Built-in variables available during flow execution:

- `sys.callId` - Current call ID
- `sys.callStatus` - Call status
- `sys.callDirection` - Inbound or outbound
- `sys.answeredBy` - Human or machine
- `sys.contactId` - Contact ID
- `sys.contactPhone` - Contact's phone number
- `sys.contactName` - Contact's full name
- `sys.organizationId` - Organization ID
- `sys.programId` - Program ID

---

## T

### TTS (Text-to-Speech)

Technology that converts written text into spoken audio. Used in Play nodes to dynamically speak content like names, numbers, or dates.

---

## V

### Variable

A named value that can be set, read, and modified during flow execution. Types include flow variables (set during execution), custom attributes (from contact data), contact fields, and system variables.

---

### Voicemail

When AMD detects an answering machine, the call is routed to the `onVoicemail` output of the Dial node. You can play a message and hang up, or handle it differently.
