Getting started with Gomobile takes just a few minutes. This guide covers obtaining credentials and verifying your connection to the API.

## Get your API credentials

To access the Gomobile API, you'll need API credentials from our team.

<Info>
**Ready to get started?** [Request your API key](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1F6_7OIDNq8_lWgKPyP-DudF3dvBTl31X4dqVf5St2zE) and our team will set you up within 24 hours.
</Info>

Once you receive your credentials, you're ready to start making API calls.

## Verify your setup

After receiving your API key, verify everything is working by fetching your profile:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.gomobile.ma/api/users/me \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

You should see your user details along with your organization information.

## Environment setup

We recommend storing your credentials as environment variables:

```bash
# Add to your .bashrc, .zshrc, or equivalent
export GOMOBILE_API_URL="https://api.gomobile.ma/api"
export GOMOBILE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

For production applications, consider using a secrets manager or environment-specific configuration.

## API base URL

All API requests go to:

```
https://api.gomobile.ma/api
```

For testing and development, you may have access to a staging environment. Check with your administrator for the appropriate URL.

## SDK options

While Gomobile provides a REST API that works with any HTTP client, we're working on official SDKs for popular languages:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Coming soon
- **Python** - Coming soon

In the meantime, you can use any HTTP library in your preferred language.

## Next steps

Now that you're set up, learn how authentication works in detail:
