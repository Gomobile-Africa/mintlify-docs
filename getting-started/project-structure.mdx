Understanding how Gomobile organizes resources helps you design better campaigns. This page explains the hierarchy and relationships between different entities.

## The big picture

Everything in Gomobile lives under an organization. Here's how the pieces connect:

```
Organization
├── Users (people who can access the platform)
├── Contacts (people you call)
├── Audiences (groups of contacts)
├── Flows (call logic templates)
├── Programs (campaign configurations)
│   └── Executions (running instances of programs)
├── Audio Files (recorded messages)
├── Dictionaries (word-to-audio mappings)
└── Custom Attributes (extra contact fields)
```

## Organizations

An organization is your top-level container. It represents your company or team and isolates your data from other users of the platform.

Key properties:

- **Name** - Your company or team name
- **Slug** - A unique URL-friendly identifier
- **Plan** - Your subscription tier (trial, free, basic, advanced, enterprise)
- **Timezone** - Default timezone for scheduling
- **Currency** - For billing purposes

Most organizations have one-to-many users who share access to the same contacts, flows, and programs.

## Users and roles

Users belong to an organization and can perform actions based on their permissions. Currently, Gomobile supports:

- **Regular users** - Can manage contacts, audiences, flows, and programs
- **Staff** - Additional administrative capabilities

Each user can be issued an API key for programmatic access. [Request an API key](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1F6_7OIDNq8_lWgKPyP-DudF3dvBTl31X4dqVf5St2zE) to get started.

## Contacts and audiences

**Contacts** are the people you call. At minimum, a contact needs a phone number. You can also store:

- Name (first, last, or full)
- Email address
- Location (address, city, state, zip)
- Custom attributes (any additional data you need)

**Audiences** are groups of contacts. Think of them as segments or lists. A contact can belong to multiple audiences, and audiences can overlap.

This separation gives you flexibility:

- Create contacts once, reuse across campaigns
- Segment by any criteria (region, customer type, etc.)
- Update contact info without recreating audiences

## Flows

Flows define what happens during a call. They're built from nodes connected by outputs:

- **Dial** - Places the outbound call
- **Play** - Plays audio to the recipient
- **DTMF** - Collects keypad input
- **Record** - Records the recipient's voice
- **Condition** - Branches based on variables
- **Set Variable** - Stores data for later use
- **Hangup** - Ends the call

Flows are reusable templates. Create one flow and use it across multiple programs.

## Programs and executions

**Programs** are campaign configurations. They combine:

- An audience (who to call)
- A flow (what to do during the call)
- A schedule (when to start/stop)
- A DID pool (which numbers to call from)
- A retry strategy (how to handle failures)
- Pause windows (when not to call)

**Executions** are running instances of programs. When you launch a program, you create an execution. The execution tracks progress:

- How many contacts have been called
- How many succeeded or failed
- Current status (running, paused, completed)

You can run multiple executions of the same program—useful for recurring campaigns.

## Audio and dictionaries

**Audio files** are pre-recorded messages you can play during calls. Upload WAV files and reference them in your flows.

**Dictionaries** map words or numbers to audio files. They're essential for dynamic content:

- Read phone numbers digit by digit
- Announce dates in the right format
- Support multiple languages (Arabic, French, etc.)

## Custom attributes

Standard contact fields don't cover every use case. Custom attributes let you store additional data:

- Account balances
- Subscription status
- Preferred language
- Any business-specific information

Define attributes at the organization level, then set values on individual contacts. You can reference these values in flows for personalized call experiences.
