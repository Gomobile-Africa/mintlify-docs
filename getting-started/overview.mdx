This section walks you through setting up Gomobile and making your first automated campaign. By the end, you'll understand how authentication works, how to structure your projects, and how to trigger a basic campaign.

<Info>
**Need API access?** [Request your API key](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1F6_7OIDNq8_lWgKPyP-DudF3dvBTl31X4dqVf5St2zE) to get started with Gomobile.
</Info>

## What you'll learn

- How to authenticate with the Gomobile API
- The basics of contacts, audiences, and flows
- How to create and launch your first program
- How to monitor execution and results

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Gomobile account (contact your administrator or sales team)
- Basic familiarity with REST APIs
- A tool for making HTTP requests (curl, Postman, or your preferred HTTP client)

## Quick overview

Gomobile follows a straightforward workflow:

1. **Create contacts** - Add the people you want to reach
2. **Build an audience** - Group contacts into targetable segments
3. **Design a flow** - Define what happens during the interaction
4. **Set up a program** - Configure when and how to execute the campaign
5. **Launch and monitor** - Start the execution and track results

Each of these steps has its own section in the documentation. But first, let's get you authenticated and ready to make API calls.
